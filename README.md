# AoC 2023

Advent of Code is a set of 25 Christmas-themed programming challenges that are released every day from December 1 to December 25. The challenges are algorithmic (leetcode-style) problems that involve string manipulation, math, or graphs. They get progressively harder each day. These are my solutions to 2023's Advent of Code.
