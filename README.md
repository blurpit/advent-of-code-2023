# AoC 2023

Advent of Code is a set of 25 Christmas-themed programming challenges that are released every day from December 1 to December 25. The challenges are algorithmic (leetcode-style) problems that involve string manipulation, math, graphs, etc. They get progressively harder each day. These are my solutions to 2023's Advent of Code.

All of my solutions are written in pure python, with no external libraries for any of the algorithms (save for a couple uses of Numpy).
